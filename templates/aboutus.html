        <h1>About FlameGuard</h1>
        <p>
            FlameGuard is a next-generation intelligent solution designed to predict and mitigate the risk of forest fires using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. With climate change and extreme weather patterns increasing the frequency and intensity of forest fires globally, there is an urgent need for advanced technological tools to safeguard our ecosystems and communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution leverages comprehensive environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and fuel moisture, to predict the probability of forest fire occurrence with remarkable accuracy. By providing early warnings, FlameGuard helps to prevent disasters, reduce economic losses, and protect human lives, wildlife, and forests.
